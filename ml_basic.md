# Google Study Jam

## QuikLabs

* Google Speech API 퀵랩: 영어 음성 -> 영어 텍스트 리턴.

* Google Natural language API 퀵랩: 자연어 텍스트에 대한 다양한 분석 결과를 내놓는 API이다. 예를 들어, 문장성분 분석/감정 분석/등등.



## Coursera: Launching into Machine Learning

* entire purpose of ML is to make predictions on new data.
* you wil learn to differentiate b/w the major categories of ML problems.
* identify why deep learning is so popular.



* supervised learning
  * features -> label = prediction problem

  * regression = continuous labels. MSE.

  * Classification = discrete labels. make decision boundary. Cross-entropy.

* unsupervised learning

  * description problem



* ML History
  * linear regression: Y = W * X
  * Perceptron: single layer perceptron was modeled on the human brain, but there are simple functions (XOR) that is cannot learn. ==>??
  * Neural Network: nonlinear activation function 이 없다면 multi-layer perceptron은 single layer 로 압축된다.
